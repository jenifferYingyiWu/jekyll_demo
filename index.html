Roll vanilla, or generate a site for your project to quickly get started.
You get one site per GitHub account and organization,
and unlimited project sites. Ready? Let’s get started.

    User or organization site Project site 

    Create a repository

    Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

    If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.
    What git client are you using?
        A terminal GitHub for Windows GitHub for Mac I don't know 
    Clone the repository

    Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
Hello World

Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:

cd username.github.io

echo "Hello World" > index.html
Push it

Add, commit, and push your changes:

git add --all

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git push -u origin master
…and you're done!

Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io.
